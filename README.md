# Lyon e-appointment-notification

Mini project I made when I was trying to get an appointment for a passport right after Covid (waiting times were around 6 months).

After managing to get an appointment, my passport request was denied for peculiar reasons and I was told to get another appointment.

Not ready to wait for half a year again, this small script was made in order to warn when a place became vacant.

Got an appointment for the day after and saved my upcoming vacation.

The appointment website is https://rendez-vous.lyon.fr/eAppointment/element/jsp/appointment.jsp.

It is possible that:
- You may not be able to access the site it if your IP is not detected as in France.
- The site's structure may have changed, so this script is likely not working as expected for today's version.
